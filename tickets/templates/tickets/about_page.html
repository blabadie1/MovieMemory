			<p class="text">Movie Memory is a site made for all sentimental filmgoers. Many times, going to the movies means more than just watching a screen. Films can both transport us to other worlds and lead us to understand different perspectives. The settings we're in and companions we have while watching these films can also impact our observations. With this application, you can quickly and easily record the experiences you had viewing your favorite movies.<br></p>
			
			<p class="text">Every ticket holds the essential information needed to document what makes going to the theater special; after you see a film, add it to your list! Simply add, edit, or delete tickets to form your personal collection. And don't worry about seeing all your films in a theater &mdash; viewings from home can be just as memorable.<br></p>
